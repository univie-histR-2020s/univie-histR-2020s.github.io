## Starting with our first workbook:

Now, download a workbook file ([`01_worksheets_familiar-with-r.Rmd.zip`](../../files/01_worksheets_familiar-with-r.Rmd.zip)). Unzip it and open in `RStudio`. Let's work through it!

**NB:** More information on R Markdown:

* <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/> 

## Reference materials:

* *R Primer* (<https://dh-r.lincolnmullen.com/primer.html>) in: Lincoln A. Mullen, *Computational Historical Thinking: With Applications in R (2018–):* <https://dh-r.lincolnmullen.com>.
	* Use the this primer as a quick introduction to the `R` language, or as a reference for the rest of the course.
* Your `R` installation may ‘speak’ your main language. It is nice on one hand, but can be quite inconvenient in class, where the main language is English. You may have to do cast some spells to switch `R` into English. Possible solutions can be found here: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13575180/how-to-change-language-settings-in-r/>
