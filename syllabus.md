# Aims, contents and method of the course

The course will offer a practical introduction into R programming language, which is currently one of the most popular choices of humanists interested in investigating humanities problems with computational methods. The focus of the course is text analysis. The course will have three main parts: first, you will be introduced to the basics of R; second, you will learn about main text analysis methods; third, you will work on your own text analysis project. The language of the course is English.

# Course Evaluation 

Assessment will be based on class participation (20%), homework assignments (30%), and a final project (50%). Final projects can be prepared either individually or in groups. No prior programming experience is required, but familiarity with the command line and basic principles of programming will be beneficial. 

# Class Participation

Each class session will consist in large part of practical hands-on exercises led by the instructor. BRING YOUR LAPTOP! We will accommodate whatever operating system you use (Windows, Mac, Linux), but it should be a laptop rather than a tablet. Don’t forget that asking for help counts as participation!

# Homework

Just as in research and real life, collaboration is a very good way to learn and is therefore encouraged. If you need help with any assignment, you are welcome to ask a fellow student. If you do work together on homework assignments, then when you submit it please include a brief note (just a sentence or two) to indicate who did what.

**NB:** On submitting homework, see below.

# Final Project

The final project is your own research project that uses collections of texts of your interest and research methods introduced inthe course. You are encouraged to explore methods outside of those covered within the course. Ideally, your research project should be directly related to your main research project that you undertake in your studies. You are welcome to work in groups on your final projects, but make sure to discuss that with the instructor first.
